{"name":"Nimbus","tagline":"The browser designed for me, not you","body":"Nimbus is a somewhat hacky Web browser coded in Python 3, using either Qt 5\r\nvia PyQt5, or Qt 4 via either PyQt4 or PySide. It is tailored specifically\r\nfor my use case, but I have open-sourced it due to 1) personal ideology, and\r\n2) personal convenience. Maybe someone will find it useful for something. Be\r\nwarned that there are no claims of stability, security, or usability in\r\nNimbus, since it is being made for no one but myself.\r\n\r\nNimbus more or less covers the following use case:\r\n* X11 user.\r\n* Heavy use of keyboard shortcuts.\r\n* Long periods of time spent in fullscreen mode.\r\n* Limited use of bookmarks and history.\r\n* Lots of forum browsing.\r\n* General dislike of ads.\r\n* Some basic desire to add features to the browser.\r\n* Use of GitHub as an image hosting service.\r\n\r\n[The wiki](https://github.com/foxhead128/nimbus/wiki) contains information\r\non security advisories, extensions, and some questions and statements you\r\nmay have.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n======\r\n\r\nNimbus depends on Python >=3.2 and either PyQt5, PyQt4, or PySide, with\r\npython3-dbus and feedparser as optional dependencies. It is possible that it\r\nwill work in versions of Python 3 below 3.2 as well, but this has not been\r\ntested before.\r\n\r\nNimbus does not work in Python 2.x and I have no plans to support it.\r\n\r\nYou can install all of Nimbus's dependencies on Debian-based platforms\r\nusing the following command:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtwebkit python3-dbus python3-dbus.mainloop.pyqt5 python3-feedparser\r\n\r\nRunning Nimbus on Linux\r\n======\r\n\r\nSimply run the following:\r\n\r\n    ./nimbus\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can try the following:\r\n\r\n    ./lib/nimbus.py\r\n\r\n![Nimbus running on Debian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foxhead128/fh-images/master/nimbus-themed.png)<br>\r\n*Nimbus running on Debian*\r\n\r\nInstalling Nimbus on Linux\r\n======\r\n\r\n**Note:** You don't have to install Nimbus in order to run it; see previous\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nIf you want to install Nimbus system-wide, you will need setuptools. On\r\nDebian-based platforms, you can install it with the following command:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, run the following:\r\n\r\n    sudo python3 ./setup.py install\r\n    \r\nUninstalling Nimbus on Linux\r\n======\r\n\r\nSimply run the following:\r\n\r\n    ./uninstall.sh\r\n\r\nRunning Nimbus on other platforms\r\n======\r\n[The wiki](https://github.com/foxhead128/nimbus/wiki) contains instructions on\r\ngetting Nimbus to run on Windows and OS X.\r\n\r\nLicensing information\r\n======\r\n\r\nSee LICENSE.md for more details.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
